# Partnerize

This repository will use a `client.py` to connect to Partnerize server. The client will do all the basic extractions.

`util` folder contains all the functions that can be reused in a lot of other scripts so you can move it with you in 
the future.

`main.py` is the only file you actually have to run to extract the data.
